"AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."


Rationale: To reduce cost, I had to reduce the RDS Read Replica instance type from db.m5.12xlarge instance to db.m5.4xlarge and also change it from Provisioned IOPS SSD to General Purpose SSD.reduced the EC2 instances from t3.2xlarge instance to t3.xlarge instance. incase of an increased traffic, Auto-scaling is enabled.
